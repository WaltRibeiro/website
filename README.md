## Branching strategy 
!Peer review

## Goals
The technical goals for this project are:
- Usability on web and mobile
- Use a Progressive Web App (PWA) approach (via ReactJS) to solve this

## Architecture
This Github Pages site runs on a static page built using Markdown. I'm considering:
- ReactJS (https://reactjs.org)
  - To build the static content components
- React Bootstrap (https://react-bootstrap.netlify.com)
  - To provide pre-built components with Bootstrap-styling baked-in
